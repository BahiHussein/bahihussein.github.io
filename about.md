I'm A Software Engineer/Teacher from Cairo, Egypt. Specialized in software development and Embedded systems software engineering. I alwayes enjoied science, math and technical things as a kid, but i didn't get into software engineering until i was in collage. After seeing how much i enjoyed it, i have decided to spend my life looking for new things tolearning and building great softwares. However, i'm highly interested in developing security applications, algorithmes and design patterns. I believe that development with no purpose is distruction and coding without pattern is waste of time.
