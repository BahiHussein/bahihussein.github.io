I'm A Software Engineer/Developer from Cairo, Egypt. Specialized in software development and Embedded systems software engineering. I always enjoied science, math and technical things as a kid, but i didn't get into software engineering until i was in college. After seeing how much i enjoyed it, i have decided to spend my life looking for new things to learn and building great softwares. Although i enjoy development in general, i'm more interested in developing security applications, algorithms and design patterns. However, I believe that development with no purpose is destruction and coding without pattern is waste of time.
